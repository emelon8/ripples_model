# ripples_model
The Brunel and Wang (2003) hippocampal ripples model (with some edits) and code for analyzing the outputs of the model.

This repository includes both their original C code (given by them, kindly, and edited by me in various iterations), as well as a Python implementation of their code.

This repository also includes Python code used for analyzing the output of the model. This code can be found in the simulation_data/ directory.
